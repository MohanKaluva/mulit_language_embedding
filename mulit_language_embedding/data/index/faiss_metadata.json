    "text": "Dota 2 is a 2013 multiplayer online battle arena ( MOBA ) video game by Valve . The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients ( DotA ) , a community - created mod for Blizzard Entertainment ' s Warcraft III : Reign of Chaos . Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players , with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map . Each of the ten players independently controls a character known as a hero that has unique abilities and differing styles of play . During a match , players collect experience points ( XP ) and items for their heroes to defeat the opposing team ' s heroes in player versus player ( PvP ) combat . A team wins by being the first to destroy the other team ' s Ancient , a large durable structure located in the center of each base . Development of Dota 2 began in 2009 when IceFrog , lead designer of Defense of the Ancients , was hired by Valve to design a standalone remake in the Source game engine . It was released for Windows , OS X , and Linux via the digital distribution platform Steam in July 2013 , following a Windows - only open beta phase that began two years prior . Dota 2 is fully free - to - play with no heroes or any other gameplay element needing to be bought or otherwise unlocked . Valve supports the game as a service , selling loot boxes and a battle pass subscription system called Dota Plus that offer non - gameplay altering virtual goods in return , such as hero cosmetics and audio replacement packs . The game was ported to the Source 2 engine in 2015 , making it the first game to use it . Dota 2 has a large esports scene , with teams from around the world playing in various professional leagues and tournaments . Valve organizes The International , the game ' s premier tournament which is held annually . Internationals feature a crowdfunded prize money system that has seen amounts in upwards of US $ 40 million , making Dota 2 one of the most lucrative esports .",

In addition to playing live to audiences in arenas and stadiums , broadcasts of them are also streamed over the internet and sometimes simulcast on television , with several million in viewership numbers . Despite criticism going towards its steep learning curve and overall complexity , Dota 2 was praised for its rewarding gameplay , production quality , and faithfulness to its predecessor , with many considering it to be one of the greatest video games of all time . It has been one of the most played games on Steam since its release , with over a million concurrent players at its peak . The popularity of the game has led to merchandise and media adaptations , including comic books and an anime series , as well as promotional tie - ins to other games and media . The game allows for the community to create their own gamemodes , maps , and cosmetics , which are uploaded to the Steam Workshop .
