The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients ( DotA ) , a community - created mod for Blizzard Entertainment ' s Warcraft III : Reign of Chaos . Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players , with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map . Each of the ten players independently controls a character known as a hero that has unique abilities and differing styles of play . During a match , players collect experience points ( XP ) and items for their heroes to defeat the opposing team ' s heroes in player versus player ( PvP ) combat . A team wins by being the first to destroy the other team ' s Ancient , a large durable structure located in the center of each base . Development of Dota 2 began in 2009 when IceFrog , lead designer of Defense of the Ancients , was hired by Valve to design a standalone remake in the Source game engine . It was released for Windows , OS X , and Linux via the digital distribution platform Steam in July 2013 , following a Windows - only open beta phase that began two years prior .",
